# FinPred

### Description of Intended Use
FinPred is an R package to be used for the analysis and prediction of financial time series. It contains functions for analysis such as ones to the create tables of summary statistics and visualizations of graphs for correlations between assets. It can also be used to perform model selection for various time series prediction and machine learning models given data and sets of hyperparameters to tune.

### Installation Instructions
Enter the command 
```
remotes::install_github("jeroda7105/FinPred")
```
in the R console. The package can then be imported with the command
```
library(FinPred)
```

### What is Left in the Project
What remains for the completion of the project with respect to functionality is 
to finish the functions for visualization and the remaining ones related to model 
selection. Furthermore, I will complete the documentation for the functions,
add a vignette for the package, and add examples of using the package
with real world data.
